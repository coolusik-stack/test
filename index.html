            <h2><span class="section-icon">💡</span> Why Balanced Meals Matter</h2>
            <p>A balanced diet is one of the most important steps you can take toward a healthier lifestyle. Each meal should include the right mix of macronutrients — proteins, carbohydrates, and healthy fats — to keep your body energized and your mind sharp throughout the day.</p>

            <div class="tip-cards">
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🌅 Breakfast Power</h3>
                    <p>Eating a nutritious breakfast kickstarts your metabolism and helps maintain steady blood sugar levels. Studies show that people who eat breakfast regularly tend to have better concentration and lower BMI.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>☀️ Lunch Balance</h3>
                    <p>Your midday meal should replenish energy without causing an afternoon slump. Focus on lean proteins with complex carbohydrates and vegetables to stay productive through the afternoon.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🌙 Light Dinner</h3>
                    <p>Eating a lighter dinner at least 2-3 hours before bedtime supports better digestion and sleep quality. Choose easily digestible proteins and plenty of vegetables for your evening meal.</p>

            <h2><span class="section-icon">🔬</span> The Science Behind Balanced Nutrition</h2>
            <p>Your body needs three macronutrients — protein, carbohydrates, and fat — in the right proportions to function optimally. Understanding how each one works can help you make smarter food choices every day.</p>

            <div class="tip-cards">
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🥩 Protein: The Builder</h3>
                    <p>Protein provides 4 kcal per gram and is essential for muscle repair, immune function, and enzyme production. Adults need approximately 0.8–1.0 g per kg of body weight daily. Our menus include lean sources like chicken, fish, tofu, and legumes to meet this need.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🍚 Carbs: The Fuel</h3>
                    <p>Carbohydrates (4 kcal/g) are your brain's primary energy source. Complex carbs from whole grains, sweet potatoes, and oats provide sustained energy and fiber, while simple sugars cause blood sugar spikes and crashes. Our recommendations prioritize complex carbohydrates.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🥑 Fat: The Protector</h3>
                    <p>At 9 kcal per gram, fats are the most calorie-dense macronutrient. Healthy unsaturated fats from avocados, nuts, olive oil, and fatty fish support brain health, hormone production, and absorption of vitamins A, D, E, and K.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="info-banner">
                <p><strong>The Ideal Plate:</strong> Nutrition experts recommend filling half your plate with vegetables and fruits, one quarter with lean protein, and one quarter with whole grains. This simple visual method ensures nutritional balance without the hassle of calorie counting.</p>

            <h2><span class="section-icon">💧</span> Hydration and Your Health</h2>
            <p>Water is often called the "forgotten nutrient," yet it makes up about 60% of your body weight and is involved in virtually every bodily function. Proper hydration improves digestion, energy levels, skin health, and cognitive performance.</p>

                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>📏 How Much to Drink</h3>
                    <p>The general recommendation is about 8 cups (2 liters) per day, but individual needs vary based on activity level, climate, and body size. A simple check: if your urine is pale yellow, you're well-hydrated. Dark yellow means you need more fluids.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>⏰ When to Drink</h3>
                    <p>Start your day with a glass of water to rehydrate after sleep. Sip throughout the day rather than gulping large amounts at once. Drinking a glass before meals can also help with portion control and digestion.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🍉 Beyond Water</h3>
                    <p>Water-rich foods like watermelon, cucumbers, oranges, and soups contribute to your daily fluid intake. Herbal teas are another great option. Limit sugary drinks and excessive caffeine, which can promote dehydration.</p>
