            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Healthy Daily Menu was created with a simple but powerful goal: to make balanced, nutritious eating accessible to everyone. We believe that healthy eating shouldn't be complicated, expensive, or time-consuming. Our free tool generates personalized meal plans and shopping lists so you can focus on what matters — enjoying good food and living well.</p>

            <h2>What We Offer</h2>
            <p>Our platform provides three core features designed to simplify your healthy eating journey:</p>

            </div>

            <h2>Our Approach to Nutrition</h2>
            <p>Every meal in our database has been carefully selected based on widely accepted nutritional guidelines. We focus on whole foods, lean proteins, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Our meal suggestions are designed to provide a balanced caloric intake that supports an active, healthy lifestyle.</p>
            <p>We prioritize variety to ensure you get a wide range of vitamins, minerals, and other essential nutrients throughout the week. From Mediterranean-inspired dishes to Asian-influenced meals, our database spans diverse cuisines to keep your palate excited and your body nourished.</p>

            <h2>Bilingual Support</h2>
            <p>Healthy Daily Menu is fully available in both English and Korean. We automatically detect your browser's language preference and redirect you to the appropriate version. You can also manually switch between languages at any time using the language toggle at the top of every page.</p>

            <h2>Privacy and Transparency</h2>
            <p>We value your privacy. All your preferences and generated meal plans are stored locally in your browser — we never send your personal data to our servers. For more details, please read our <a href="privacy-en.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
