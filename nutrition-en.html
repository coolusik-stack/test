            <h2>Understanding Macronutrients</h2>
            <p>Macronutrients are the three main categories of nutrients that provide your body with energy. Every food you eat contains some combination of these three building blocks, and understanding their roles is the first step toward making informed dietary choices.</p>

            <div class="tip-cards">
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🥩 Protein (4 kcal/g)</h3>
                    <p>Proteins are made of amino acids that build and repair muscles, organs, and tissues. Adults generally need 0.8–1.0 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day. Excellent sources include chicken breast, fish, tofu, legumes, eggs, and Greek yogurt.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🍞 Carbohydrates (4 kcal/g)</h3>
                    <p>Carbs are your body's preferred energy source, especially for the brain and muscles during exercise. Choose complex carbohydrates like whole grains, oats, brown rice, and sweet potatoes, which release energy slowly and keep you full longer.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🥑 Fats (9 kcal/g)</h3>
                    <p>Healthy fats are essential for hormone production, brain function, and absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Focus on unsaturated fats from avocados, olive oil, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish like salmon.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="info-banner">
                <p><strong>The Ideal Plate Method:</strong> A practical approach to balanced meals is to fill half your plate with vegetables and fruits, one quarter with lean protein, and one quarter with whole grains. This visual method eliminates the need for calorie counting while ensuring nutritional balance.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Essential Micronutrients</h2>
            <p>While macronutrients provide energy, micronutrients — vitamins and minerals — regulate virtually every process in your body. Deficiencies in these nutrients can lead to fatigue, weakened immunity, and chronic health issues. Here are the key micronutrients to prioritize:</p>

            <div class="tip-cards">
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🦴 Calcium &amp; Vitamin D</h3>
                    <p>Calcium builds strong bones and teeth, while vitamin D helps your body absorb it. Dairy products, fortified plant milks, leafy greens, and sunlight exposure are the best sources. Adults need about 1,000 mg of calcium and 600 IU of vitamin D daily.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🩸 Iron</h3>
                    <p>Iron carries oxygen through your bloodstream and supports energy levels. Red meat, lentils, spinach, and fortified cereals are rich sources. Pairing iron-rich foods with vitamin C (like citrus fruits) significantly improves absorption.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🧠 Omega-3 Fatty Acids</h3>
                    <p>These essential fats support brain health, reduce inflammation, and protect heart function. Fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines), walnuts, flaxseeds, and chia seeds are excellent sources. Aim for at least two servings of fatty fish per week.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🍊 Vitamin C &amp; Antioxidants</h3>
                    <p>Vitamin C boosts immune function, aids collagen production, and acts as a powerful antioxidant. Citrus fruits, bell peppers, strawberries, broccoli, and kiwi are among the best sources. Adults need about 75–90 mg daily.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>The Role of Fiber</h2>
            <p>Dietary fiber is a type of carbohydrate that your body cannot digest, yet it plays a crucial role in overall health. There are two types: soluble fiber (found in oats, beans, and apples) dissolves in water and helps lower cholesterol, while insoluble fiber (found in whole grains, nuts, and vegetables) adds bulk to stool and promotes regular bowel movements.</p>
            <p>Most adults should aim for 25–30 grams of fiber per day, but the average person only consumes about 15 grams. Increasing fiber intake gradually — along with plenty of water — can improve digestion, help manage blood sugar levels, and contribute to a healthy weight by keeping you feeling full longer.</p>

            <h2>Hydration: The Forgotten Nutrient</h2>
            <p>Water makes up about 60% of your body weight and is involved in nearly every bodily function, from regulating temperature to transporting nutrients. Even mild dehydration (as little as 1–2% of body weight) can impair concentration, mood, and physical performance.</p>

            <div class="tip-cards">
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>💧 How Much to Drink</h3>
                    <p>A general guideline is 8 cups (2 liters) per day, but individual needs vary based on activity level, climate, and body size. A simple way to check: your urine should be pale yellow. Dark yellow suggests you need more fluids.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🫖 Beyond Water</h3>
                    <p>Herbal teas, water-rich fruits (watermelon, cucumbers, oranges), and broths all contribute to your daily fluid intake. Limit sugary drinks and excessive caffeine, which can actually promote fluid loss.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>⏰ Timing Matters</h3>
                    <p>Drink a glass of water first thing in the morning to rehydrate after sleep. Sip water throughout the day rather than consuming large amounts at once. Drinking before meals can also help with portion control.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>Popular Evidence-Based Dietary Approaches</h2>
            <p>While there's no single "best" diet for everyone, several dietary patterns have strong scientific support for promoting long-term health. Understanding these approaches can help you find what works best for your lifestyle:</p>

            <div class="tip-cards">
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🫒 Mediterranean Diet</h3>
                    <p>Emphasizes olive oil, fish, whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables with moderate red wine. Extensively researched for reducing heart disease risk, it was named the best overall diet by U.S. News for seven consecutive years.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🥬 DASH Diet</h3>
                    <p>Designed to lower blood pressure, DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while limiting sodium, saturated fat, and added sugars.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🌱 Plant-Forward Eating</h3>
                    <p>Not strictly vegetarian, this approach centers meals around plants while still allowing moderate amounts of animal products. It's linked to lower rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🔄 Intuitive Eating</h3>
                    <p>Rather than following strict rules, intuitive eating teaches you to listen to your body's hunger and fullness cues. It encourages a healthy relationship with food by removing guilt and promoting mindful eating habits.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>Understanding Portion Sizes</h2>
            <p>Even healthy foods can contribute to weight gain when consumed in excess. Learning to estimate portion sizes without a food scale is a practical skill that supports long-term healthy eating:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Protein (palm-sized):</strong> A serving of meat or fish should be roughly the size and thickness of your palm — about 85–115 grams (3–4 oz).</li>
                <li><strong>Grains (fist-sized):</strong> One serving of cooked rice, pasta, or cereal should be about the size of your closed fist — approximately one cup.</li>
                <li><strong>Fats (thumb-sized):</strong> One tablespoon of oils, nut butters, or butter is roughly the size of your thumb tip.</li>
                <li><strong>Vegetables (two handfuls):</strong> Raw vegetables can be measured as two cupped handfuls per serving — eat these generously.</li>
                <li><strong>Fruits (fist-sized):</strong> One serving of whole fruit is about the size of a tennis ball or your fist.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-banner">
                <p><strong>Mindful Eating Tip:</strong> Eating slowly and without distractions allows your brain to register fullness signals, which typically take about 20 minutes. Put your fork down between bites, chew thoroughly, and savor the flavors. Studies show that mindful eaters consume 20–25% fewer calories per meal on average.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Meal Timing and Frequency</h2>
            <p>The question of how often to eat is just as important as what you eat. While traditional advice suggests three meals a day, emerging research shows that the optimal approach depends on your individual lifestyle and goals:</p>
            <p><strong>Three balanced meals</strong> work well for most people and simplify planning. This approach aligns with our meal recommendation tool, which provides nutritionally balanced breakfast, lunch, and dinner options.</p>
            <p><strong>Including 1–2 small snacks</strong> between meals can help maintain stable blood sugar and prevent overeating at the next meal. Good snack options include a handful of nuts, a piece of fruit with yogurt, or vegetables with hummus.</p>
            <p><strong>Avoid eating too close to bedtime.</strong> Finishing your last meal at least 2–3 hours before sleep supports better digestion and sleep quality. Late-night eating is associated with acid reflux, disrupted sleep patterns, and weight gain over time.</p>

            <h2>Building Sustainable Habits</h2>
            <p>The most effective diet is one you can maintain for life. Instead of drastic changes, focus on small, consistent improvements:</p>

            <div class="tip-cards">
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🎯 Start Small</h3>
                    <p>Add one extra serving of vegetables per day, or swap one processed snack for a whole food alternative. Small wins build momentum and create lasting change more effectively than extreme diets.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>📝 No Perfection Required</h3>
                    <p>The 80/20 rule is a practical guideline: aim to eat nutritious meals 80% of the time, and allow flexibility for treats and social occasions the other 20%. Guilt-free enjoyment is part of a healthy relationship with food.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>👥 Make It Social</h3>
                    <p>Cooking and eating with others improves dietary quality and emotional well-being. Shared meals tend to include more variety, more vegetables, and promote slower, more mindful eating.</p>
                </div>
