            <h2><span class="section-icon">🧠</span> Smart Grocery Shopping Tips</h2>
            <p>A well-organized grocery list is the foundation of healthy eating. Here are some tips to make your shopping trips more effective and budget-friendly:</p>

            <div class="tip-cards">
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🥬 Shop the Perimeter</h3>
                    <p>Fresh produce, lean meats, and dairy are usually located around the perimeter of the store. Start there before heading to the center aisles for pantry staples.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🏷️ Read Labels</h3>
                    <p>Check nutrition labels for hidden sugars, sodium, and artificial additives. Choose products with short ingredient lists that you can actually pronounce.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🌿 Buy Seasonal</h3>
                    <p>Seasonal fruits and vegetables are fresher, more nutritious, and often cheaper. They also taste better because they are harvested at peak ripeness.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🧊 Frozen Is Fine</h3>
                    <p>Frozen fruits and vegetables are flash-frozen at peak nutrition and can be just as healthy as fresh. They last longer and help reduce food waste.</p>

            <h2><span class="section-icon">🏪</span> Essential Pantry Staples</h2>
            <p>A well-stocked pantry is the backbone of healthy cooking. These versatile staples allow you to whip up nutritious meals even on days when you haven't shopped for fresh ingredients:</p>

            <div class="tip-cards">
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🌾 Grains &amp; Legumes</h3>
                    <p><strong>Brown rice, quinoa, oats, whole wheat pasta, canned beans, dried lentils.</strong> These provide complex carbohydrates, fiber, and plant-based protein. They store for months and form the base of countless healthy meals from grain bowls to soups.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🫒 Oils &amp; Condiments</h3>
                    <p><strong>Extra virgin olive oil, soy sauce, vinegar, honey, mustard, spices.</strong> Quality oils and seasonings transform simple ingredients into flavorful meals. Olive oil is rich in heart-healthy monounsaturated fats and antioxidants.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🥫 Canned &amp; Preserved</h3>
                    <p><strong>Canned tomatoes, tuna, coconut milk, broth, tomato paste.</strong> These shelf-stable items are nutritious and incredibly convenient. Canned tomatoes, for example, are actually higher in lycopene (an antioxidant) than fresh tomatoes.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🥜 Nuts &amp; Seeds</h3>
                    <p><strong>Almonds, walnuts, chia seeds, flaxseeds, peanut butter.</strong> Packed with healthy fats, protein, and fiber, nuts and seeds make excellent snacks and meal toppings. Store them in the fridge or freezer to maintain freshness.</p>

            <h2><span class="section-icon">📋</span> Understanding Food Labels</h2>
            <p>Reading nutrition labels is one of the most valuable skills for healthy shopping. Here's a quick guide to help you decode what's on the packaging and make informed choices:</p>

            <div class="tip-cards">
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>📊 Serving Size</h3>
                    <p>All nutritional information is per serving — not per package. A bag of chips may list 150 calories, but if it contains 3 servings, the whole bag is 450 calories. Always check the serving size first.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🔍 Ingredient Order</h3>
                    <p>Ingredients are listed by weight, from most to least. If sugar, corn syrup, or a fat appears in the first three ingredients, the product is likely not a healthy choice. Look for whole foods (like "whole wheat flour") listed first.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🚫 Hidden Sugars</h3>
                    <p>Sugar goes by over 50 names: high-fructose corn syrup, dextrose, maltose, sucrose, agave nectar, cane juice, and more. The WHO recommends limiting added sugars to under 25 grams (6 teaspoons) per day.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>🧂 Sodium Watch</h3>
                    <p>Processed foods are often loaded with sodium. Aim for less than 2,300 mg of sodium per day (about 1 teaspoon of salt). Compare similar products and choose the lower-sodium option when possible.</p>
